### How would you scale this for production?
To scale this application for production:
1.Database: Migrate from SQLite to a managed PostgreSQL or MongoDB cluster (e.g., AWS RDS or MongoDB Atlas) for concurrency and reliability. Add Redis for caching frequent queries (e.g., fetching user profile).
2.API: Vertical scaling initially, then horizontal scaling using a Load Balancer (Nginx/AWS ELB) with multiple Node.js instances (PM2 cluster mode).
3.Frontend: Build static assets and serve via a CDN (Cloudfront/Vercel) for global low latency.
4.Security: Enforce HTTPS, add Rate Limiting (express-rate-limit), and use HTTP-only cookies for JWT storage instead of LocalStorage to prevent XSS.
